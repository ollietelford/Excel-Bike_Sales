# Excel - Bike Sales

A large dataset of bike, clothing and accessories dataset was taken and pivot tables used to compare Revenue against Profit, Country and Age Group with charts created to better understand the data.



## Line Chart
This shows the PivotTable and line chart created to summarise and display the Profit and Revenue growth from 2017 to 2021 in millions of US Dollars. A clear growth of both Revenue and Profit can be seen from 2017 to 2021 with a slight dip in 2019. However, post 2019, the rate of growth of Revenue is exceeding the rate of growth of Profit, although they are both still increasing.
